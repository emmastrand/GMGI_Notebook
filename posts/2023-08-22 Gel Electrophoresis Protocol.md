# Gel Electrophoresis Protocol 

Written for lab at GMGI. 

A gel matrix that contains an electrical field used to separate DNA strands based on size. The bigger strands move through the gel slower and tend to stay closer to the wells compared to the small strands that will move faster and end up closer to the end of the gel.

“Run to red” – the black (-) (top of the rig next to the wells) and red (+) (bottom of the rig near the end of the gel) cords of the gel rig. DNA bands are negatively charged (because of the phosphate group) so they will run to the bottom of the gel (red).

Equipment is similar to this [Thermo Scientific Kit](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/owl-easycast-b1-mini-gel-electrophoresis-systems/p-6013222#?keyword=) and can be run on any gel electrophoresis equipment.  

### Protcol steps 

Small gel box: 40 mL  

**Making a gel** 

1. Mix the desired amount of 1X TAE buffer and agarose powder to produce the desired % agarose gel mixture. Use a weigh boat to measure agarose and using the Erlenmeyer flask from the gel bench to measure the TAE. 
- 1%: 40 mL of 1X TAE buffer and 0.4 grams of agarose.  
- 1.5%: 40 mL of 1X TAE buffer and 0.6 grams of agarose.  
- 2%: 40 mL of 1X TAE buffer and 0.8 grams of agarose.  
2. Mix in an Erlenmeyer flask, add the agarose by taco-ing the weigh boat and carefully pouring the powder as to not get it stuck to the side of the flask. Pour up to your desired volume with new 1X TAE.  
3. Put a scrunched Kimwipe in the mouth of the flask and put in the microwave for 1 minute. Every 20 seconds open microwave and swirl flask.

> Use glove because glass gets hot and don’t be afraid to check too often because it can boil over. Microwaving time can vary, so keep adding time until when you look at the liquid when swirling it is completely clear and there are no “flakes”.

4. Let the flask cool down for ~1 minute.    
5. Add 4 uL of FastRed (for a 40 mL mixture. This value will change for other sizes).    
6. Set up gel cast mold, place small tray in the gel box sideways and make sure there is an air-tight seal with the rubber sides.    
7. Put desired comb size into the tray.  
8. Let gel cool up to 5 minutes in the flask before pouring into the gel tray, if you can safely hold it, that's a good sign it's ready.  
9. Using a pipette tip, move any bubbles to the side of the tray.  
10. Let harden until opaque and cool ~30 min.  
11. Take out and orient the gel with the comb side to the top of the box. Take the comb out of the hardened gel.  
12. Pour enough “used”/old TAE buffer into the gel box to cover the gel with a thin layer of liquid and make sure there are no dimples where the wells are.  
13. In a new strip tube, make 6 μl aliquots of your DNA samples.     
14. Add 1 μl of loading dye to each sample and vortex and spin down to mix.

> An alternative is to use parafilm instead of a new strip tube.  

15. Add 5 μl of the appropriate ladder (1kb ladder for post DNA ext) to the first well in the gel.  
16. Add your samples to each well: ~6-7 μl. Make sure you have made a map in your notebook that shows the order of samples.  
17. Make sure gel is set up to “run towards red”.  
18. Plug black cable into black insert and red cable into red insert of the gel box.  
19. Turn box on and make sure voltage is set to desired value, amp is set to desired value, and time is set to desired value.  

> To evaluate DNA quality after extraction, I commonly use 1% gel for 100V, 2A, 45 min. I'm expecting high molecular weight DNA from extractions so I won't need more 45 minutes for the bands to run further down on the gel. 

20. Once done, take the tray out of the boxy and using a Kimwipe, slide the gel into your hands. *insert details for machine at gmgi.* 

Pour the leftover TAE from the gel box into the used TAE container using a funnel kept in the drawer.  
Rinse the gel box, comb, and flask in DI type II water.
