# DNA Extraction Kit Comparison

We have two options for our epigenetic aging project with Haddock: [Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506) and [Machery-Nagel NucleoSpin Tissue mini kit for DNA from cells and tissue](https://www.mn-net.com/us/nucleospin-tissue-mini-kit-for-dna-from-cells-and-tissue-740952.50?number=&c=5291). We already have a couple leftovers from previous projects so I'm testing a few. *Qiagen kit is EXPIRED as of 2021.* 

Haddock epigenetic aging repo: https://github.com/emmastrand/Epigenetic_aging. Below lab work information is also in our BOX drive in Fisheries Epigenetic Aging project. 

### Expected Yield 

We are not using RNase A in this test. We are likely going to use it in our larger protocol to process all of our Haddock samples. 

Qiagen kit: Fish fin input 20 mg should yield 10-20 ug total DNA.    
MN: up to 20-35 μg of pure genomic DNA with an A260/A280 ratio between 1.7 and 1.9 from <25 mg of tissue

### Sample selection 

This is based on samples we are confident we need to extract. I don't expect any DNA extraction differences based on length, age, season, or sex. We have more than enough tissue from each sample for quality DNA.

## Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit protocol 

### Reaganet preparation 

**Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2** are supplied as concentrates.   
- Before using for the first time, add the appropriate volume of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle and shake thoroughly.   
- Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2 are stable for at least 1 year after the addition of ethanol when stored closed at room temperature (15–25°C).  

**Buffer AL**  
- Buffer AL and ethanol (96–100%) are added in the same step. Buffer AL and ethanol can be premixed and added together in one step to save time when processing multiple samples.   
- Buffer AL is stable for 1 year after the addition of ethanol when stored closed at room temperature (15–25°C).  

**Proteinase K** 
- Proteinase K is stable for at least one year after delivery when stored at room temperature (15–25°C).  

**Buffer ATL**  
- optimized buffer for tissue lysis  

**Buffer AE**:  
- 10 mM Tris·Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 9.0. Elution with Buffer AE guarantees optimal recovery and stability of eluted DNA.  
- should be used at room temperature (15–25°C) - heating before use isn't necessary. 


### Protocol: Purification of Total DNA from Animal Tissues (Spin-Column Protocol)

Starts on Page 28 on DNeasy Blood and Tissue Handbook 2020 

Notes:  
- All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature (15–25°C) in a microcentrifuge.  
- Vortexing should be performed by pulse-vortexing for 5–10 s.  
- Check ATL and AL buffers for precipitates. If necessary, warm to 56C until precipitates have fully dissolved.  
- Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2 are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working solution.  
- Preheat a thermomixer, shaking water bath or rocking platform to 56°C for use in step 2. If using frozen tissue, equilibrate the sample to room temperature (15–25°C).

#### Steps 

1. Preheat thermomixer to 56°C.  
2. Fill a 15 mL falcon tube with 10% bleach, a 15 mL falcon tube with Type II DI water, and a 15 mL falcon tube with 70% ethanol. 

Sterilization of clippers: submerge the clippers in 10% bleach solution and wipe with a kimwipe. Submerge the clippers in Type DII Water and wipe with a kim wipe. Finally, submerge the clippers in the 70% ethanol solution. 

3. Fill a cooler with ice and take the 10 samples (listed above) out of the freezer.    
4. Label new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the Extraction ID (usually I'd use GMGI ID but I'm repeating sample IDs here).    
5. Fill each 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with 180 uL Buffer ATL.    

Complete the following steps one sample at a time and repeat as needed.   

6. Sterilize the clippers as described above.   
7. Remove the fin clip from the sample 2 mL screw cap tube. Cut a ~2x2 mm piece from the fin clip and place in the appropriately labled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. If possible, cut this small piece into even smaller pieces. Qiagen recommends cutting into several pieces to ensure more efficient lysis (but ~2x2 total). These clippings should be fully submerged in the Buffer ATL.  
8. Return the fin clip to the original tube and place back on ice.  

Repeat as needed for each sample.  

9. Add 20 uL Proteinase K.  
10. Vortex 5-10 seconds.  
11. Incubate at 56°C until tissue is completely lysed. Check after 2 hours. The recommended time period is 1-3 hr. Vortex occasionally during incubation to disperse the sample or place in a thermomixer, shaking water bath or on a rocking platform.  After incubation the lysate may appear viscous, but should not be gelatinous as it may
clog the DNeasy Mini spin column.  

*RNase step goes here in future protocol. Add 4 μl RNase A (100 mg/ml), mix by vortexing, and incubate for 2 min at room temperature (15–25°C)* 

12. Vortex for 15 sec.   
13. Add 200 μl Buffer AL to the sample.  
14. Vortex for 15 sec.  
15. Add 200 μl ethanol (96–100%).  
16. Vortex for 15 sec. It is essential that the sample, Buffer AL, and ethanol are mixed immediately and thoroughly by vortexing or pipetting to yield a homogeneous solution. Buffer AL and ethanol can be premixed and added together in one step to save time when processing multiple samples.      

> A white precipitate may form on addition of Buffer AL and ethanol. This precipitate does not interfere with the DNeasy procedure. Some tissue types (e.g., spleen, lung) may form a gelatinous lysate after addition of Buffer AL and ethanol. In this case, vigorously shaking or vortexing the preparation is recommended. 

17. Pipet the entire mixture from previous step into DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube.  
18. Centrifuge at ≥6,000 x g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min.  
19. Discard flow-through and collection tube and place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube.  
21. Add 500 μl Buffer AW1.  
22. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6,000 x g (8,000 rpm).  
23. Discard flow-through and collection tube and place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube.  
25. Add 500 μl Buffer AW2.  
26. Centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g (14,000 rpm).  

> It is important to dry the membrane of the DNeasy Mini spin column, since residual ethanol may interfere with subsequent reactions. This centrifugation step ensures that no residual ethanol will be carried over during the following elution. Following the centrifugation step, remove the DNeasy Mini spin column carefully so that
the column does not come into contact with the flow-through, since this will result in carryover of ethanol. If carryover of ethanol occurs, empty the collection tube, then reuse it in another centrifugation for 1 min at 20,000 x g (14,000rpm).

27. Discard flow-through and collection tube.  
28. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a clean 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube labeled with the appropriate organism ID.  
29. Pipet 50 μl Buffer AE directly onto the DNeasy membrane (Elution 1).  
30. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.  
31. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6,000 x g (8,000 rpm) to elute.  
32. Pipet 50 μl Buffer AE directly onto the DNeasy membrane (Elution 2).  
33. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.  
34. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6,000 x g (80,00 rpm) to elute. 

> Elution with 100 μl (instead of 200 μl) increases the final DNA concentration in the eluate, but also decreases the overall DNA yield (see Figure 2, page 23 on DNeasy Blood and Tissue Handbook 2020). I'm not worried that we won't have enough yield, but higher concentrations will help us later on. Putnam Lab had previously done a test to optimize elution steps. We've always used 2 steps of 50 uL and got good results.  

## Macherey-Nagel DNA Extraction Protocol 

https://www.mn-net.com/media/pdf/5b/d0/d9/Instruction-NucleoSpin-Tissue.pdf 

### Reaganet preparation 

**Wash Buffer B5**: Add the indicated volume of ethanol (96 – 100 %) to Wash Buffer B5 Concentrate. Mark the label of the bottle to indicate that ethanol was added. Wash Buffer B5 can be stored at 15 – 25 °C for at least one year.   

**Proteinase K**: Add the indicated volume of Proteinase Buffer PB to dissolve lyophilized Proteinase K. Proteinase K solution is stable at -20 °C for at least 6 months.

### Standard protocol for human or animal tissue and cultured cells

Before starting the preparation: 
- Check if Buffer B5 and Proteinase K were prepared according to section 3.  
- Set an incubator or water bath to 56 °C  

#### Steps 

1. Preheat thermomixer to 56°C.  
2. Fill a 15 mL falcon tube with 10% bleach, a 15 mL falcon tube with Type II DI water, and a 15 mL falcon tube with 70% ethanol. 

Sterilization of clippers: submerge the clippers in 10% bleach solution and wipe with a kimwipe. Submerge the clippers in Type DII Water and wipe with a kim wipe. Finally, submerge the clippers in the 70% ethanol solution. 

3. Fill a cooler with ice and take the 10 samples (listed above) out of the freezer.    
4. Label new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the Extraction ID (usually I'd use GMGI ID but I'm repeating sample IDs here).    
5. Fill each 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with 180 uL Buffer T1.    

Complete the following steps one sample at a time and repeat as needed.   

6. Sterilize the clippers as described above.   
7. Remove the fin clip from the sample 2 mL screw cap tube. Cut a ~2x2 mm piece from the fin clip and place in the appropriately labled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. If possible, cut this small piece into even smaller pieces. Qiagen (so we'll use it here too) recommends cutting into several pieces to ensure more efficient lysis (but ~2x2 total). These clippings should be fully submerged in the Buffer T1.  
8. Return the fin clip to the original tube and place back on ice.  

Repeat as needed for each sample.  

> If processing several samples, Proteinase K and Buffer T1 may be premixed directly before use. Do not mix Buffer T1 and Proteinase K more than 10 – 15 min before addition to the sample: Proteinase K tends to self-digest in Buffer T1 without substrate. 

9. Add 25 μL Proteinase K.  
10. Vortex to mix for 5-10 seconds.  
11. Incubate at 56 °C until complete lysis is obtained (at least 1 – 3 h). For this protocol, start with 2 hours and check after that time period to make sure completely lysed. Take photos to document change. I'm predicting 2-3 hr range. Vortex occasionally during incubation or use a shaking incubator. 

> If RNA-free DNA is crucial for downstream applications, a RNase digest may be performed: Add 20 μL RNase A (10 mg/mL) solution (not included; see ordering information) and incubate for an additional 5 min at room temperature. 

*Will not do the above step for this test period but for our sampling processing, we likely will. 

12. Vortex to mix for 5-10 seconds.    
13. Add 200 μL Buffer B3, vortex vigorously for 15-20 seconds.    
14. Incubate at 70 °C for 10 min.    
15. Vortex to mix for 5-10 seconds.    

> If insoluble particles are visible, centrifuge for 5 min at high speed (e.g., 11,000 x g) and transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube (not provided).

16. Add 210 μL ethanol (96 – 100 %) to the sample and vortex vigorously for 15-20 seconds.  

> After addition of ethanol a stringy precipitate may become visible. This will not affect the DNA isolation. Be sure to load all of the precipitate on the column in the following step. 

17. For each sample, place one NucleoSpin® Tissue Column into a Collection Tube.  
18. Pipet the entire sample onto the column.  
19. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g.  
20. Discard Collection Tube with flowthrough and place the column in a new Collection Tube (provided).  

> If the sample is not drawn completely through the matrix, repeat the centrifugation step at 11,000 x g. Discard flowthrough.

21. Add 500 μL Buffer BW (1st wash).  
22. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g.   
23. Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the Collection Tube. 
24. Add 600 μL Buffer B5 to the column (2nd wash).    
25. Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g.   
26. Discard flowthrough and place the column back into the Collection Tube.    
27. Centrifuge the column for 1 min at 11,000 x g. Residual ethanol is removed in this step.    
28. Place the NucleoSpin® Tissue Column into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (not provided).    
29. Add 50 μL Buffer BE.    
30. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min. Centrifuge 1 min at 11,000 x g.  
31. Add 50 μL Buffer BE.  
32. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min. Centrifuge 1 min at 11,000 x g.  

*The above elution steps were altered from standard protocol based on MN's recommendations and those matching my notes in the Qiagen protocol above.*

## Gel 

After confirming we do have DNA in our samples, this is to test the quality. 

1% agarose gel, 70V, 2A, 45 minutes. 

1. Measure 0.4 g agarose in a weigh boat. Place in small flask (reagent room in the back of lab).  
2. Pour 40 mL of **new** 1X TAE in the flask (Fisheries bench).   
3. Microwave for 1 minute in 30 second intervals (gel rig bench at the front of the lab).        
4. Quick spin FastRed solution (shelf above the gel rig set-up).        
5. Add 4 uL of FastRed (for a 40 mL mixture) and swirl to mix. *This value will change with size of gel.*    
6. Insert gel tray into gel box sideways properly so that the rubber lines seal with the gel box.   
7. Insert the appropriate size gel comb.  
8. Pour mixture into the gel tray and let cool until the gel hardens.  
9. Remove the gel comb slowly and careful to not tear any of the gel wells.  
10. Fill the gel box with **used/old** TAE (shelf above the gel rig set-up) so that the gel itself is completely submerged.  
11. Pipet 6 uL of DNA sample onto parafilm.    
12. Add 1 uL of 6X loading dye to each sample. Slowly pipet up and down to mix.  
13. Pipet 5 uL of loading dye directly into first well.  
14. Pipet each sample into individual wells following the loading dye well. 
15. Place the gel cover on top and make sure the red plug is at the bottom of the cover and gel (the samples should "run to red"). The black plug should be at the top of the gel on the same side as the wells.

One hour was plenty for the digestion. I can definitly decrease the amount of tissue I'm putting in to increase the quality without sacrificing the quantity of DNA we get. 70+ is way more than needed and usually associated with more degraded DNA. 

## 2023-08-23 Extraction Test Round 2

This time we added the RNase A step (although enzyme was from 2020 hopefully not degraded) and used a smaller amount of tissue. I found the tissue to be hard to cut a little piece without getting a lot. I did my best but probably even more room to decrease the amount of tissue for input.
