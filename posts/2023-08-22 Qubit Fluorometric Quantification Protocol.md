Includes a description for the differences between kits. 
- We use BR and HS kits for different protocols.  


### Prep 

Determine n number: Number of samples + 2 + % error 

Calculate Reagent and Buffer master mix:   
- n μl of Quant-IT Reagent  
- 199 * n μl of Buffer  

### Protocol Steps 

1. Create master mix of Qubit Buffer and Quant-IT Reagent usign the calculations above. Often a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube is needed for the total amount of master mix.  
2. Vortex and spin down master mix.  
3. Set up thin walled tubes: enough for each of your samples plus 2 more for standards.  
4. Label those thin walled Qubit tubes with the Extraction sample ID.  
5. Add 190μl of master mix to the 2 tubes for the standards.  
6. Add 199μl of master mix to each of your sample tubes.  
7. Take standards out of the fridge (in the fridge in the reagent room).  
8. Add 10 μl of Standard 1 to the first standard thin walled tube.  
9. Add 10 μl of Standard 2 to the second standard thin walled tube.  
10. Add 1 μl of sample to the corresponding thin walled sample tube.  
11. Vortex and spin down all tubes.  
12. Choose appropriate assay in the Qubit and read standard tubes.  
13. If your standard values are not near the range of values in these graphs then your master mix was probably made wrong and need to start over.  
14. Read each sample tube one at a time. Our settings are 1μl of sample and we want the output to be ng/μl.  
15. Read your samples twice and calculate an average per sample to use moving forward.  
16. All components are safe and can be disposed of in the tip buckets or trash.  
17. Pipet tips are recycled at GMGI so dispose of those in the appropriate bin.
