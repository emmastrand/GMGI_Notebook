# Qiagen DNeasy DNA Extraction Kit Protocol

250 prep Kit (Cat #69506): https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506 

Based on the Qiagen DNeasy Extraction handbook found [here](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=68f29296-5a9f-40fa-8b3d-1c148d0b3030&lang=en). 

**Kit contents**: listed on Page 4 of the handbook above.    
**Storage**: DNeasy spin columns, DNeasy 96 plates and all buffers should be stored dry, at room temperature (15–25°C) and are stable for 1 year under these conditions, if not otherwise stated on the label.  DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits contain a ready-to-use Proteinase K solution, which is supplied in a specially formulated storage
buffer. Proteinase K is stable for at least 1 year after delivery when stored at room temperature. For storage longer than one year or if ambient temperatures often exceed 25°C, we suggest storing Proteinase K at 2–8°C.
