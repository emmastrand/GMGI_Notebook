# Qiagen DNeasy DNA Extraction Kit Protocol

Originally optimized for Epigenetic Aging Project for Haddock fish fin clip samples that were stored in 100% molecular grade ethanol at -80C. 

250 prep Kit (Cat #69506): https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506 

Based on the Qiagen DNeasy Extraction handbook found [here](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=68f29296-5a9f-40fa-8b3d-1c148d0b3030&lang=en). We're working with the  “Protocol: Purification of Total DNA from Animal Tissues (Spin-Column Protocol)”, found on **page 30**, is for use with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit, for purification of DNA from animal tissues, including rodent tails.

**Sample collection**: Best results are obtained with fresh material or material that has been immediately frozen and stored at –90°C to –15°C. Repeated freezing and thawing of stored samples should be avoided, since this leads to reduced DNA size. Use of poor-quality starting material will also lead to reduced length and yield of purified DNA. 

**Storage**: DNeasy spin columns, DNeasy 96 plates and all buffers should be stored dry, at room temperature (15–25°C) and are stable for 1 year under these conditions, if not otherwise stated on the label.  DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits contain a ready-to-use Proteinase K solution, which is supplied in a specially formulated storage
buffer. Proteinase K is stable for at least 1 year after delivery when stored at room temperature. For storage longer than one year or if ambient temperatures often exceed 25°C, we suggest storing Proteinase K at 2–8°C.

**Starting input**: Tissue input for fish fin clips has been optimized by Qiagen at 20-25 mg. A 2 mm cube of most animal tissues weighs approximately 10–15 mg. To obtain optimum DNA yield and quality, it is important not to overload the DNeasy spin column or DNeasy 96 plate, as this can lead to significantly lower yields than expected (see Figure 1, page 16 of the handbook above).

**Elution steps**: In my previous lab, we optimized this for output desired and Qiagen has recommendations listed in page 23 of the handbook linked above. Buffer AE is 10 mM Tris·Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 9.0. Elution with Buffer AE guarantees optimal recovery and stability of eluted DNA. Heating Buffer AE before elution is not necessary. 

**Expected yield**: Yields of genomic DNA will vary from sample to sample depending on the amount and type of material processed. In addition, the quality of starting material will affect DNA yield. 20-25 mg of animal tissue is expected to yield 10-20 ug total of DNA.

### Materials 

**Kit contents**: listed on Page 4 of the handbook linked above. 
Additional materials needed:    
- Pipettes and pipette tips  
- Vortexer  
- 100% molecular grade Ethanol  
- RNase A (10 mg/ml)  
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml or 2 ml)  
- Microcentrifuge with rotor for 1.5 ml and 2 ml tubes  
- Thermomixer, shaking water bath or rocking platform for heating at 56°C

### Reagent Preparation 

**Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2**: Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2 are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the appropriate volume of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle and shake thoroughly. Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2 are stable for at least 1 year after the addition of ethanol when stored closed at room temperature (15–25°C).   
**Buffer AL**: Buffer AL and ethanol (96–100%) are added in the same step. Buffer AL and ethanol can be premixed and added together in one step to save time when processing multiple samples. Buffer AL is stable for 1 year after the addition of ethanol when stored closed at room temperature (15–25°C).   
**Proteinase K**: DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kits contain ready-to-use Proteinase K supplied in a specially formulated storage buffer. The activity of Proteinase K is 600 mAU/ml solution (or 40 mAU/mg protein) and has been chosen to provide optimal results. Proteinase K is stable for at least one year after delivery when stored at room temperature (15–25°C). To store for more than one year or if ambient temperature often exceeds 25°C, we suggest keeping Proteinase K at 2–8°C. 

### Protocol: Purification of Total DNA from Animal Tissues (Spin-Column Protocol)

Notes:  
- All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature (15–25°C) in a microcentrifuge.  
- Vortexing should be performed by pulse-vortexing for 5–10 s.  
- Check ATL and AL buffers for precipitates. If necessary, warm to 56C until precipitates have fully dissolved.  
- Buffer AW1 and Buffer AW2 are supplied as concentrates. Before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol (96–100%) as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working solution.  
- Preheat a thermomixer, shaking water bath or rocking platform to 56°C for use in step 2. If using frozen tissue, equilibrate the sample to room temperature (15–25°C).


1. Preheat thermomixer to 56°C.  
2. Fill a 15 mL falcon tube with 10% bleach, a 15 mL falcon tube with Type II DI water, and a 15 mL falcon tube with 70% ethanol.   
3. Fill a cooler with ice and take the desired samples out of the freezer.    
4. Label new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the Extraction ID.      
5. Fill each 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube with 180 uL Buffer ATL.    
6. Sterilization of clippers: submerge the clippers in 10% bleach solution and wipe with a kimwipe. Submerge the clippers in Type DII Water and wipe with a kim wipe. Finally, submerge the clippers in the 70% ethanol solution.   
7. Remove the fin clip from the sample 2 mL screw cap tube. Cut a ~2x2 mm piece from the fin clip and place in the appropriately labled 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. If possible, cut this small piece into even smaller pieces. Qiagen recommends cutting into several pieces to ensure more efficient lysis (but ~2x2 total). These clippings should be fully submerged in the Buffer ATL.  
8. Return the fin clip to the original tube and place back on ice.  

Repeat 6-8 as needed for each sample.  

9. Add 20 uL Proteinase K.  
10. Vortex 5-10 seconds.  
11. Incubate at 56°C for 1 hour until tissue is completely lysed. After incubation the lysate may appear viscous, but should not be gelatinous as it may clog the DNeasy Mini spin column.    
12. Add 20 uL of 10 mg/mL RNase A (or 4 uL of 100 mg/mL).  
12. Vortex for 15 sec.   
13. Add 200 μl Buffer AL to the sample.  
14. Vortex for 15 sec.  
15. Add 200 μl ethanol (96–100%).  
16. Vortex for 15 sec. It is essential that the sample, Buffer AL, and ethanol are mixed immediately and thoroughly by vortexing or pipetting to yield a homogeneous solution. Buffer AL and ethanol can be premixed and added together in one step to save time when processing multiple samples.      

> A white precipitate may form on addition of Buffer AL and ethanol. This precipitate does not interfere with the DNeasy procedure. Some tissue types (e.g., spleen, lung) may form a gelatinous lysate after addition of Buffer AL and ethanol. In this case, vigorously shaking or vortexing the preparation is recommended. 

17. Pipet the entire mixture from previous step into DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube.  
18. Centrifuge at ≥6,000 x g (8,000 rpm) for 1 min.  
19. Discard flow-through and collection tube and place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube.  
21. Add 500 μl Buffer AW1.  
22. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6,000 x g (8,000 rpm).  
23. Discard flow-through and collection tube and place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube.  
25. Add 500 μl Buffer AW2. 
26. Centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g (14,000 rpm).  

> It is important to dry the membrane of the DNeasy Mini spin column, since residual ethanol may interfere with subsequent reactions. This centrifugation step ensures that no residual ethanol will be carried over during the following elution. Following the centrifugation step, remove the DNeasy Mini spin column carefully so that
the column does not come into contact with the flow-through, since this will result in carryover of ethanol. If carryover of ethanol occurs, empty the collection tube, then reuse it in another centrifugation for 1 min at 20,000 x g (14,000 rpm).

27. Discard flow-through and collection tube.  
28. Place the DNeasy Mini spin column in a clean 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube labeled with the appropriate organism ID.  
29. Pipet 50 μl Buffer AE directly onto the DNeasy membrane (Elution 1).  
30. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.  
31. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6,000 x g (8,000 rpm) to elute.  
32. Pipet 50 μl Buffer AE directly onto the DNeasy membrane (Elution 2).  
33. Incubate at room temperature for 3 min.  
34. Centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6,000 x g (80,00 rpm) to elute. 
35. Aliquot 10 μl for subsequent gel electrophoresis (DNA quality) and qubit analysis (DNA quantity). 

> Elution with 100 μl (instead of 200 μl) increases the final DNA concentration in the eluate, but also decreases the overall DNA yield (see Figure 2, page 23 on DNeasy Blood and Tissue Handbook 2020). I'm not worried that we won't have enough yield, but higher concentrations will help us later on. Putnam Lab had previously done a test to optimize elution steps. We've always used 2 steps of 50 uL and got good results.
